  [Step state:"start-drop"]
    Kernel density estimation is a really useful statistical tool
    with an intimidating name.
    Often shortened to **KDE**, it's a technique
    that let's you create a smooth curve given a set of data.

    This can be useful if you want to visualize just the
    "shape" of some data, as a kind of continuous replacement for the discrete histogram.
    It can also be used to generate points that
    *look like they came from a certain dataset* - this behavior can power simple
    simulations, where simulated objects are modeled off of real data.

    I hope this article provides some intuition for how KDE works.
  [/Step]

  [Step state:"show-generator"]
    To understand how KDE is used in practice, let's start with some points. The white circles on
    your screen were sampled from some unknown distribution.

    As more points build up, their silhouette will roughly correspond to that distribution, however
    we have no way of knowing its true value.
  [/Step]

  [Step state:"show-estimate"]
    The blue line shows an estimate of the underlying distribution, this is what KDE produces.

    The KDE algorithm takes a parameter, *bandwidth*, that affects how "smooth" the resulting
    curve is. Use the control below to modify bandwidth, and notice how the estimate changes.

    Bandwidth: [Dynamic value:k min:0.001 max:0.1 step:0.001 /]
  [/Step]
  [Step state:"build-estimate"]
    The KDE is calculated by weighting the distances of all the data points we've seen
    for each location on the blue line. If we've seen more points nearby, the blue line is
    higher, indicating that probability of seeing a point at that location.

    Move your mouse over the graphic to see how the data points contribute to the estimation â€”
    the "brighter" a selection is, the more likely that location is.
    The red curve indicates how the point distances are weighted, and is called the *kernel function*.


    Bandwidth: [Dynamic value:k min:0.001 max:0.1 step:0.001 /]

    Next we'll see how different kernel functions affect the estimate.
  [/Step]
  [Step]
    The concept of weighting the distances of our observations from a particular point, [equation latex:"x" /],
    can be expressed mathematically as follows:

    [equation display:true]
      \hat{f}(x) =  \sum_{observations}^{}{K(\frac{x - observation}{bandwidth})}
    [/equation]

    The variable [equation latex:"K" /] represents the kernel function. Using different
    kernel functions will produce different estimates. Use the dropdown to see how changing the kernel affects the estimate.

      {label: "Triangular", value: "triangular"}
      ]` /]

    Bandwidth: [Dynamic value:k min:0.001 max:10 step:0.001 /]
    [br/]
    Amplitude: [Dynamic value:amplitude min:0.1 max:10.0 step:0.1 /]

    That's all for now, thanks for reading! I'll be making more of these
    quick explainer posts, so if you have an idea for a concept you'd like
